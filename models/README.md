# Trained model storage directory.

Possibilities:

- This directory could store trained machine learning models serialized in formats like pickle or TensorFlow SavedModel.
- It could contain model checkpoints saved during the training process for resuming or fine-tuning later.
- It might also store evaluation metrics or performance statistics for trained models.
